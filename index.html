                  Cyber Insurance: What Executives Think It Covers vs. What It
                  Actually Does
                </h2>
                <p class="font-ibm mb-6">
                  The bottom line up front: Most organizations discover the gaps
                  in their cyber insurance policy at exactly the wrong moment —
                  after a breach. Understanding what your policy actually covers
                  is a governance decision, not an IT decision.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-6">
                  Cyber insurance has become a boardroom staple. In a world of
                  rising breach costs and regulatory pressure, executives
                  understandably treat it as a safety net. The problem is that
                  many policies are purchased with assumptions that don't
                  survive contact with reality.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-6">
                  The most common misconception is that cyber insurance
                  functions like general liability — that if something goes
                  wrong, the policy pays. In practice, most policies are riddled
                  with conditions. Coverage can be denied if the insurer
                  determines that basic security controls weren't in place at
                  the time of the incident. "Basic controls" is often defined in
                  the fine print, not the sales conversation, and may include
                  things like multi-factor authentication across all systems,
                  encrypted backups, and documented incident response plans. If
                  your organization wasn't meeting those standards when the
                  breach occurred, your claim may be rejected.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-6">
                  A second blind spot is the distinction between first-party and
                  third-party coverage. First-party covers your own losses —
                  recovery costs, business interruption, forensic investigation.
                  Third-party covers claims made against you by customers or
                  partners whose data was compromised. Many executives assume
                  they have both. Not all policies include both.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-6">
                  Ransomware coverage deserves particular scrutiny. Some
                  policies exclude ransom payments entirely. Others cap them
                  well below what attackers typically demand. And increasingly,
                  insurers are requiring organizations to demonstrate they have
                  offline, tested backups before ransomware coverage will apply
                  — because an organization that can restore from backup has
                  less reason to pay, which reduces the insurer's exposure.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-6">
                  The executive action here isn't to become a policy expert.
                  It's to ask your security and legal teams three specific
                  questions: What does our policy actually exclude? What
                  security controls are we required to maintain to keep coverage
                  valid? And when did we last test whether our incident response
                  process meets the insurer's requirements?
                </p>

                  CASE STUDY: WHEN THE POLICY DIDN'T PAY
                </h2>
                <p class="mb-6">
                  A mid-sized logistics company suffered a ransomware attack
                  that encrypted its core operations platform and took the
                  business offline for eleven days. The financial impact — lost
                  revenue, recovery costs, and emergency IT support — exceeded
                  $4 million. The company had cyber insurance with a stated
                  limit well above that figure.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-6">The claim was denied.</p>
                <p class="mb-6">
                  The insurer's investigation found that the company had not
                  implemented multi-factor authentication on its remote access
                  systems, a control explicitly listed as a coverage requirement
                  in the policy. The organization's IT team had been aware of
                  the gap and had flagged it internally. It was on a remediation
                  roadmap. It had not been prioritized.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-6">
                  The denial triggered a secondary crisis. With no insurance
                  payout, the company was forced to draw on credit facilities to
                  cover recovery costs, which strained relationships with
                  lenders and delayed a planned acquisition. The CISO left the
                  organization within six months. The story eventually became
                  public through litigation when the company challenged the
                  denial — and lost.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-6">
                  What makes this case instructive isn't the ransomware attack
                  itself. Ransomware happens. What's instructive is the chain of
                  decisions that made it catastrophic: a policy purchased
                  without a full controls audit, a security gap that was known
                  but deprioritized, and an executive team that assumed coverage
                  meant protection.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-6">
                  The question this case leaves for any executive is a simple
                  one: do you know what your policy requires you to have in
                  place right now?
